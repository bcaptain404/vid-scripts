# Audio Cleanup Script - Ultimate To-Do / Wishlist

This is a list of high-IQ, AI-powered, or just generally smart/ambitious features that can be added to the audio-cleanup script. Consider this a living wishlist for future upgrades:

## 🧠 Things To Add (Not in Current Script)

1. ** -recog-content: Real-Time Audio Content Recognition**
   - Detect clipping, background noise, or “bar noise.”
   - Suggest or apply de-noising, gating, or multi-band compression if detected.

2. ** --recog-genre: Genre/Content Classification**
   - Guess if the source is vocals, podcast, live bar, acoustic music, etc.
   - Auto-select or tweak filter presets accordingly.

3. ** --isolate-*: Speech/Music/Vocal Isolation**
   - Use Spleeter or Demucs (Python, needs more deps) to auto-separate vocals and instruments.
   - Apply different EQ/compression to each and re-combine.

4. ** --iname: Intelligent Output Naming**
   - Auto-rename the output based on audio characteristics, date, genre guess, etc.

5. ** --ltarget: Loudness Targeting**
   - Auto-detect if the track is for YouTube/Spotify/Podcast/etc.
   - Target industry-standard LUFS with smart normalization (and warn if you’re way off).

6. **Multi-Band Analysis**
   - Analyze per-band RMS and spectral flatness.
   - Suggest advanced filters: e.g., “You have boomy lows, want a notch at 120Hz?”

7. ** --des: De-essing / Harshness Detection**
   - Automatically identify and suggest de-essing if there’s too much sibilance.

8. ** --mnoise: Noise Floor Measurement**
   - Warn if the track is mostly silence, or background noise is higher than -45dBFS.

9. **Glitch/Fault Detection**
   - Flag and optionally cut out audio dropouts, DC offset, clipping, etc.

10. **Smart Output Reporting**
    - Print before/after waveform stats, maybe even generate an output plot (png).

11. **Update and Self-Test**
    - Add a `--self-test` that uses bundled sample files and ensures the whole chain works.

12. **Upgrade to Full Python/FFmpeg Pipeline**
    - Switch from Bash to a Python CLI (argparse, click, typer) for more maintainability, cross-platform use, and AI upgrades.

13. **Automatic Dependency Check/Install**
    - Check for missing ffmpeg filters, offer to build or install, or fall back to alternatives.

14. ** --gui: GUI or Web Front-End**
    - Wrap it all in a simple local Flask web GUI so you can drag/drop files, tweak settings, and click “go.”

15. ** --tempo: A/V Tempo Correction**
    - adjust for when the musician is speeding up & slowing down - without pitch changes

16. ** -vinterp: Frame Interpolation**
    - where frames are missing, copy-paste/interpolate/something so that it isn't just a still image

---

## Quick Wins / Smart Example Ideas
- Add basic genre detection or a `--report` flag that prints out full audio stats.
- Output fancy CLI tables, warnings, or even waveform plots.
- Offer `--self-test` to make sure everything is installed/working.
- Add fallback to "loudnorm" if "dynaudnorm" is missing in ffmpeg.
